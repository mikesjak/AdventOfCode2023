# Advent of code 2023

This repository consists of my solutions to the Advent of code 2023. My main goal for this year's AOC is to practice problem-solving and writing more readable code. 

All files have been compiled using ```g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -pedantic``` Apple clang 15.0.0, MacBook Pro M3 Pro.

All tasks are on the official [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) website.
